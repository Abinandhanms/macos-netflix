# Netflix wrapper for macOS

A very simple—*non-working*—proof-of-concept app for a `WKWebView` based app to allow viewing Netflix outside the browser on macOS. The goal is to somewhat allow a picture-in-picture style browsing and watching experience. There's a bunch of similar apps on the Mac App Store, but this one is mine, and the idea is to keep it pretty lightweight (no majorly additive features).

The app works pretty well overall, but doesn't currently play actual content (though trailers work just fine, presumably this is because of DRM), which probably makes it a non-starter. OH WELL AT LEAST WE LEARNED SOMETHING TODAY
