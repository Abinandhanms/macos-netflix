# Netflix wrapper for macOS

A very simple proof-of-concept app for a `WKWebView` based app to allow viewing Netflix outside the browser on macOS. The goal is to somewhat allow a picture-in-picture style browsing and watching experience. There's a bunch of similar apps on the Mac App Store, but this one is mine, and the idea is to keep it pretty lightweight (no majorly additive features).
